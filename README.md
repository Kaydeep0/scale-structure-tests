## Summary

Recent work in holography and quantum information suggests that spacetime connectivity emerges from quantum entanglement. This note introduces a **scale-resolved correlation profile** defined via admissible coarse-graining flows, and proposes that operational connectivity depends on how correlation is distributed across scales, not only on the total amount. An exact theorem is proven in a layered tensor-network model, and numerical simulations demonstrate noise-robust separation of states with identical total mutual information but distinct scale profiles.
